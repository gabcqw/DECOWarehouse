Previous requirement:

In this exercise, you are tasked to write a Python program that simulates operations on a company's account and a warehouse. The program should handle various commands for performing operations like adding/subtracting balance, recording sales and purchases, displaying account balance, showing warehouse status, and reviewing recorded operations.

Instructions:

1. Write a program that displays available commands upon launch. The commands are: 
  - balance
  - sale
  - purchase
  - account
  - list
  - warehouse
  - review
  - end

2. Handle each command uniquely:
  - 'balance': The program should prompt for an amount to add or subtract from the account.
  - 'sale': The program should prompt for the name of the product, its price, and quantity. Perform necessary calculations and update the account and warehouse accordingly.
  - 'purchase': The program should prompt for the name of the product, its price, and quantity. Perform necessary calculations and update the account and warehouse accordingly. Ensure that the account balance is not negative after a purchase operation.
  - 'account': Display the current account balance.
  - 'list': Display the total inventory in the warehouse along with product prices and quantities.
  - 'warehouse': Prompt for a product name and display its status in the warehouse.
  - 'review': Prompt for two indices 'from' and 'to', and display all recorded operations within that range. If ‘from’ and ‘to’ are empty, display all recorder operations. Handle cases where 'from' and 'to' values are out of range.
  - 'end': Terminate the program.

3. After executing any command, the program should again display the list of commands and prompt for the next command.

Hints:

- Use a loop to continuously prompt for commands until the 'end' command is entered.
- Keep track of the account balance and warehouse inventory.
- Remember to handle edge cases, like invalid command inputs, negative amounts during a 'purchase' operation, or out-of-range indices during a 'review' operation.
- The balance, sale, and purchase commands are remembered by the program.
- Handle user inputs that are not as expected. The program should not crash in these cases, but instead, it should display an appropriate error message.


Adding text database:
In this exercise, you'll extend the functionality of the company account and warehouse operations program from the previous lesson. You'll implement saving and loading of account balance, warehouse inventory, and operation history to/from a text file.

1. You can store balance, inventory and history in separate files or in one file.

2. At the start of the program, if the file(s) exists, load the data from the file and use it to initialize the program state.
  - If the file does not exist or if there are any errors during file reading (e.g., the file is corrupted or not readable), handle these cases gracefully.
  - Make sure to save all the data to correct files when the program is being shutdown.

Hints:

- Use built-in Python functions for file I/O and converting data to Python objects (i.e. literal_eval).
- Remember to handle any file I/O errors that may occur.
- Think about the format in which you'll save the data to the file. The format should be easy to read back into the program.
- Always close the files after you're done with them to free up system resources.

Adding decorator:

In this exercise, you will extend the previously created accounting system by building a new `Manager` class. This class will implement the `assign` method, and actions such as `sale`, `purchase`, `balance`, etc., will be defined using decorators.

1. Extend the existing accounting system by creating a new class named `Manager`. This class will be responsible for handling various accounting operations.

2. Implement an `assign` method in the `Manager` class. This method should assign tasks to the appropriate operations in the accounting system.

3. Define the actions like `sale`, `purchase`, `balance`, etc., using Python decorators. These decorators should provide additional functionalities to these operations.

4. Test the `Manager` class and decorators by creating instances of the `Manager` class, assigning tasks, and executing various operations like `sale`, `purchase`, `balance`, etc.

Hints:

- A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. Decorators provide a simple syntax for calling higher-order functions.
- The `@` symbol is used for decorators in Python.
- You can define the decorators within the `Manager` class. If defined within the class, they should take `self` as the first argument.
- For the `assign` method, consider how tasks can be mapped to methods in your class. This might involve using a dictionary or similar data structure to map string task names to methods.
- Remember to use the `self` keyword to refer to instance variables and methods within the class.
